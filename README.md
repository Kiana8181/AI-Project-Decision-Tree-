# AI Project: Data Preprocessing and Visualization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on data preprocessing, handling missing values, visualizing data distributions, and preparing the dataset for machine learning modeling. The project utilizes Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, and `imblearn`.

## Introduction

The project involves several key steps to ensure the dataset is clean, balanced, and ready for modeling. These steps include:

- Loading the dataset
- Checking for and handling missing values
- Identifying and handling outliers
- Visualizing data distributions
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing numerical variables

Additionally, a Decision Tree algorithm is implemented from scratch to demonstrate the modeling process.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `imbalanced-learn`

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Loading the Data**: The dataset is loaded and initial exploration is conducted.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are identified and addressed.
3. **Handling Outliers**: Outliers in the dataset are detected and managed.
4. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables are encoded to numerical format.
5. **Normalizing Numerical Variables**: Numerical variables are scaled to ensure uniformity.

## Visualization

Various visualizations are created to understand the data distributions, including histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and pie charts.

## Modeling

The prepared dataset is used to train machine learning models. A Decision Tree algorithm is coded from scratch to illustrate the modeling process. Techniques like SMOTE are used to handle class imbalance.
